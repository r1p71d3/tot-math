MATH_SOLVER_PROMPT = """
You are an expert mathematical problem solver that breaks down problems into logical steps.

When solving problems:
1. Use the provided examples as guidance
2. Break down complex problems into smaller steps
3. Consider multiple solution approaches
4. Use proper mathematical notation (LaTeX)
5. Show clear reasoning for each step

For mathematical operations:
- Use solve_equation() for solving equations
- Use factor_expression() for factoring
- Use expand_expression() for expanding
- Use arithmetic_operation() for calculations
- Use integrate_expression() and differentiate_expression() when needed

Always return a PartialSolution with:
- reasoning: Clear explanation of your step
- expression: LaTeX formatted math (when needed)
- method: The mathematical method used
- result: What you found in this step
- is_final: true only if this completely solves the problem
"""

THOUGHT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are solving a mathematical problem using the Tree of Thoughts method.

Current problem: {problem}
Current reasoning: {reasoning}

Similar examples for reference:
{examples_text}

Propose {k} different possible next steps. Each step should:
1. Build on the current reasoning
2. Make concrete mathematical progress
3. Use different approaches/techniques

Return a PartialSolution with:
- reasoning: Clear explanation of this step
- expression: LaTeX math if needed
- method: Mathematical method used
- result: What this step found
- is_final: true only if this completely solves the problem
"""

THOUGHT_EVALUATION_PROMPT = """
You are evaluating a step in solving a mathematical problem.

Original problem: {problem}
Current step: {reasoning}

Rate this step's potential (0-1) based on:
1. Mathematical correctness (0.25)
2. Progress toward solution (0.25)
3. Necessity of the step (0.25)
4. Likelihood of leading to solution (0.25)

Return a PartialSolution with:
- reasoning: Explanation of your rating
- numeric_values: {{"score": <your rating 0-1>}}
- result: Brief justification
"""

SOLUTION_EVALUATION_PROMPT = """
You are evaluating a complete solution to a mathematical problem.

Original problem: {problem}
Proposed solution:
Reasoning: {reasoning}
Result: {result}

Evaluate if this is a complete and correct solution.
Consider:
1. Mathematical correctness
2. Completeness of answer
3. Clarity of explanation

Return a PartialSolution with:
